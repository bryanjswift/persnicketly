# Welcome to Persnicketly #

The goal of this webservice is to help users of [Readability][1] find high quality
content to read. Persnicketly's approach to this problem at a high level is
simple. We look at the bookmark feeds of any Readability user that allows us to
and extract their starred or favorited articles. By aggregating this information
we can help users be persnickety[2] about what they spend their most precious
resource (focus/attention) on.

## There's more to it, right? ##

In addition to bubbling good content to the top of the persnicketly reading list
we would also like to make it easier to browse good content you're interested in
by putting the good stuff in big buckets; buckets with labels like:

* Education
* Fiction
* Health
* Politics
* Technology
