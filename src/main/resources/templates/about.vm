          <h2>More on Readability</h2>
          <p>Readability allows any web page to become more readable by stripping out the distractions that make reading content on the web challenging. While there is a small membership fee 70% of that fee goes directly to publishers and content creators in your reading list. What about the other 30%? Well that goes to improving the tools and services offered to you by Readability. Pretty cool, huh?</p>
